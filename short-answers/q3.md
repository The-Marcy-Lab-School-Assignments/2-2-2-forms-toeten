# Question
Take these 4 html buttons:

```html
<button></button>
<button type="submit"></button>
<button type="reset"></button>
<button type="button"></button>
```

What is the default behavior of each button when clicked?

# Answer
The default behavior of a button inside a form with no type attribute is to submit. Adding a type="submit" will not change the default behavior. The default behavior of a button with a type attribute of "reset" will be to reset the form it's associated with. A button with a type of "button" does not have any default behavior associated with it; its actions will be defined by the developer.

# Question
Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer
Labels are needed for accesibility purposes. They allow screenreaders to see the purpose of their associated input elements. We can associate labels with inputs by having the input's id match the labels for attribute. We can also wrap input-label pairs in a div or fieldset together to make sure its clear which label goes with which input.

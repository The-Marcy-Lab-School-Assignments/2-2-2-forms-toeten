# Question
Why do you need labels for every input? What are the two ways to associate a label with an input?

# Answer
Labels are needed for accessibility purposes. They allow screen readers to see the purpose of their associated input elements. We can associate labels with inputs by having the input's id match the labels for attribute. We can also wrap input-label pairs in a div or fieldset together to make sure its clear which label goes with which input.

So close! The other way to associate a input and label the same way you would with a for attribute is by wrapping an input within a label. The way you described is great for separating the different labels and inputs from each other!
